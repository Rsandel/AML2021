<H1>CS 5043: HW5: Complex Convolutional Neural Networks</H1>

Assignment notes:
<UL>
  <LI>  Deadline: Thursday, April 8th @11:59pm.
       <P>
       
  <LI> Hand-in procedure: submit a pdf to Gradescope
       <P>
       
  <LI> This work is to be done on your own.  While general discussion
       about Python, Keras and Tensorflow is encouraged, sharing
       solution-specific code is inappropriate.  Likewise, downloading
       solution-specific code is not allowed. 
       <P>
       
  <LI> Do not submit MSWord documents.<P>

</UL>

<H2>Problem</H2>

Our objective with this homework is to explore non-serial deep network
architectures, constructed using the Keras Model API.

<UL>
  <LI>  The data set and classification problem is the same as in HW 4.
       <P>

  <LI> Implement one more more non-serial deep networks.  Possibilities include:
       <UL>
	 <LI> An inception-style network.
	      <P>

	 <LI> A network with more than one input image at the same
	      time (e.g., two input images separated by 10 time
	      steps).
	      <P>

	 <LI> A network with K input images, each processed by the
	      same single-image recognizer and the outputs combined
	      using a recurrent neural network.
	      <P>

       </UL>

<H2>Hints / Notes</H2>
<UL>

  <LI> For networks with multiple input images, you will need to alter
       either the data loading process or the generator process.   The
       key is to make sure that all of the images that are presented
       as part of one example all come from the same object.  It
       is fine to share this code with the rest of the class if you
       have a nice solution.
       
<P>

<H2>What to Hand In</H2>

Hand in a PDF file that contains:

<UL>
  <LI> Code for generating and training the network.  Some useful UNIX
       command line programs:
       <UL>
	 <LI> <B>enscript:</B> translate code (e.g., py files) into postscript files
	 <LI> <B>ps2pdf:</B>  translate postscript files into pdf files
	 <LI> <B>pdfunite:</B> merge several pdf files together
       </UL>
       <P>
  <LI> The same learning curve and confusion matrix figures as
       produced in HW 4

       <P>
  <LI> A report of the mean multi-class AUC
       <P>
  <LI> Your batch files used to run the experiments for your shallow and deep networks
       <P>
  <LI> A statistical test of the mean validation set performance of your
       best model from HW4 and your model for this assignment
       <P>


</UL>



<H2>Grades</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> 50 pts: Model generation code.  Is it correct?  clean? documented?
       <P>
       
  <LI> 50 pts: Model figures and performance.  To achieve full credit
       you must show a statistically significant improvement over your
       best HW4 model.
      <P>
       
  <LI> 10 pts: You solved the bonus problem of achieving average of 0.9 on the
       validation data set your model across the five rotations, or
       you beat the best of the TA/instructor solutions
       <P>
