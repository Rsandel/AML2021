<H2>Assignment Notes</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>  Deadline: Tuesday, March 2nd @11:59pm.
       <P>
  <LI> Hand-in procedure: submit a combined pdf of your work to the HW2 dropbox on Gradescope.
       <P>
  <LI> This work is to be done on your own.  While general discussion
       about Python, TensorFlow and Keras is okay, sharing solution-specific code is inappropriate.
       Likewise, you may not download code solutions to this problem from the network.  All code that we release may be used.
       <P>

</UL>

<H2>Data Set</H2>
We are using the BMI data set that we discussed in class.  It is
available on the supercomputer at:
<PRE>
/home/fagg/datasets/bmi/bmi_dataset.pkl
</PRE>
<P>

This is a 220MB file - please do not make local copies of the file
(you don't need to).  You are welcome to copy the file to other
machines, if you wish.  Two requirements:
<UL>
  <LI> Large data transfers to/from OSCER should be done through the
       host: dtn2.oscer.ou.edu
       <P>

  <LI> Please do not share this data set with others, and please
       delete copies after the semester is over
       <P>

</UL>
<P>

The data set contains both neural and arm movement data (the latter
being, theta, dtheta, ddtheta and torque).  In addition, there is a
"time" channel that is a time stamp for each sample.  Arm movements
are two degrees of freedom, corresponding to the shoulder and elbow, 
respectively.  Each sample of the neural data already contains the
history of each neuron over a 1 second period (20 samples at
50ms/sample).  

<P>

The data are already partitioned into 20 folds for us.  Each fold
contains multiple blocks of contiguous-time samples.  So, if one were
to plot theta as a function of time, you would see the motion of the
arm over time (with gaps).
Across the folds, it is safe to assume that the data are independent
of one-another.

<P>


<P><HR><P>
<H2>Provided Code</H2>

We are providing the following code:
<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="../code/hw/hw2/hw2_base.py">hw2_base.py</A>.  This is the heart of the
       BMI model implementation.  As such, it has a lot of features and
       is rather complicated.  You may use it in its entirety, adapt
       it to your needs, or ignore it all together.
       <P>
       
       Features include:
       
       <UL>
	 <LI> Accepts many different arguments for conducting an
	      experiment, including accepting many hyper-parameters.
	      Some hyper-parameters can be set by SLURM, allowing us to
	      perform a large number of experiments with a single
	      invocation of sbatch
	      <P>
	      
	 <LI> From the BMI data set file, it will generate
	      training/validation/testing data sets for a given
	      rotation
	      <P>

	 <LI> High-level code for conducting an individual experiment
	      and saving the results
	      <P>

       </UL>

  <LI> <A HREF="../code/hw/hw2/symbiotic_metrics.py">symbiotic_metrics.py</A>: proper
       Keras implementation of the fraction-of-variance-accounted-for
       metric (FVAF).  This implementation computes FVAF for each
       dimension independently.  
       <P>
       <UL>
	 <LI> FVAF = 1 - MSE/VAR
	      <BR>
	      MSE is the mean squared prediction error
	      <BR>
	      VAR is the variance of the quantity being predicted
	      <P>
	      
	 <LI> FVAF is related to the R-squared metric, but does not
	      suffer from the over-fitting problem that R-squared has
<P>

	 <LI> FVAF <= 1
	      <UL>
		<LI> 1 -> perfect prediction
		<LI> 0 -> no predictive power
		<LI> < 0 -> predicts more variance than exists in the data
	      </UL>
	      <P>

       </UL>

 <LI> <A HREF="../code/hw/hw2/job_control.py">job_control.py</A>: This program makes it easy to iterate through all combinations of hyper parameters. 
     The class translates a dictionary containing parameter/list pairs into a Cartesian product of all combinations
     of possible parameter values stored in a list of dictionaries and enables indexed access to this list.
       <P>

</UL>


<P><HR><P>
<H2>Part 1: Network</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> Implement a function that constructs a neural network that can
       predict arm state as a function of neural state.  The network
       should be relatively shallow (you don't need a lot of
       non-linearities to do reasonably well, here).  But, note that
       quantities such as torque or velocity can be positive or
       negative.  So, think carefully about what the output
       nonlinearity should be
       <P>
  <LI> Do not take steps to address over-fitting (we will work on this
       HW 3)
       <P>

  <LI> Arm state can be scalar (e.g., shoulder orientation) or a
       vector (e.g., shoulder and elbow velocity)
       <P>

  <LI> Train a network to predict elbow torque as a
       function of the neural state.  Useful FVAFs are: 0 < FVAF <= 1
       <P>

  <LI> 
       Produce a figure that shows both the true torque and the
       predicted torque as a function of the timestamp for the test fold.   
       <P>

</UL>

<P><HR><P>
<H2>Part 2: Multiple Runs</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> Use your code base to execute a batch of experiments on OSCER
       <P>

  <LI> The batch is a 2-dimensional grid: rotation (0...19) and number
       of training folds (1,2,3,5,10,18).  Although single experiments
       will have a short running time (2-4 minutes), each one needs to
       be executed as a separate job on OSCER (we are preparing
       ourselves for more extensive experiments)
       <P>
       
  <LI> Implement a second program that executes on your local machine
       and:
       <UL>
	 <LI> Loads all of the stored results
	      <P>

	 <LI> Computes average training/validation/testing FVAF for
	      each training fold size (average across the rotations)
	      <P>

	 <LI> Generates a plot with three curves (one for each data
	      set type): FVAF as a function of training set size
	      <P>
       </UL>
       <P>

</UL>

<P>
<H3>Hints</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> 
There are lots of hints embedded in the provided code.  Take
       the time to understand what is going on there.
<P>
  <LI> List comprehension is your friend
    <P>

</UL>

<H3>Reading Results Files</H3>
<PRE>
import os

def read_all_rotations(dirname, filebase):
    '''Read results from dirname from files matching filebase'''

    # The set of files in the directory
    files = fnmatch.filter(os.listdir(dirname), filebase)
    files.sort()
    results = []

    # Loop over matching files
    for f in files:
        fp = open("%s/%s"%(dirname,f), "rb")
        r = pickle.load(fp)
        fp.close()
        results.append(r)
    return results
</PRE>

<P>

Example:
<PRE>
filebase = "bmi_torque_0_hidden_30_drop_0.50_ntrain_%02d_rot_*_results.pkl"
results = read_all_rotations("results", filebase)
</PRE>

<P>
will find all files that match this string (* is a wildcard here).
<P>

<P><HR><P>

<H2>Expectations</H2>

Think about what the curve shapes should look like before you
       generate them.

<P>

<H2>Looking Forward</H2>
For HW 3, we will be experimenting with deeper networks and with
varying hyper-parameter choices.  As you write your code, think about
how to structure it (and your results data structures) so that you can
handle variations in other hyper-parameters.

<P><HR><P>

<H2>What to Hand-In</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> Sumbit a single combined pdf containing all associated files 
       (python files, batch scripts, Jupyter notebook, etc.)
<P>
     Instructions have been posted on Canvas for converting Jupyter notebooks
     into pdf files. 

  <LI> Do not submit MSWord files.
</UL>
<P>
